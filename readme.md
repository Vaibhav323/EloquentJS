# Eloquent Javascript Exercises

In this repository, I have worked through all the exercises from the book. As a beginner in JavaScript, I found some of the problems challenging and didn't solve all of them entirely on my own. To overcome these challenges, I utilized hints provided in the book and occasionally referred directly to the solutions.

However, my primary goal was to understand the concepts thoroughly. Therefore, I ensured that I only copied solutions after I fully grasped the underlying principles and logic. This approach helped me learn effectively and gain confidence in my JavaScript skills.

By combining independent problem-solving with guided learning, I was able to make significant progress. I'm continuing to practice and refine my skills, aiming to solve more problems independently as I grow more proficient in JavaScript.
