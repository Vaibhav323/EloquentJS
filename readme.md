# Eloquent Javascript Exercises

In this repository, I have solved all the problems which are included in **EXERCISES** of the book.
As I'm beginner to the Javascript, I didn't solve all the problems. I took help from the hints and sometimes I copied directly from solution. Main thing is I only copied solutions when I understood them.

## Problem Statements
I'll tick only those problem statements which are solved by me:
### Chapter 2: Program Structure

* [x] Looping Tringle
* [x] FizzBuzz
* [ ] Chessboard

### Chapter 3

* [x] Minimum
* [x] Recusrion
* [x] Bean Counting
